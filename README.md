# dbt Fundamentals Course

## Overview
This repository contains my work from the **dbt Fundamentals Course**, which I completed to reinforce best practices and stay sharp on core concepts. dbt has been a key tool in my work, enabling scalable data transformation and improving analytics workflows. This course served as an opportunity to refine my skills and stay ahead in the analytics engineering space.

## Why dbt?
**dbt (data build tool)** is a powerful framework that allows analysts and engineers to transform data in the warehouse using SQL and modular workflows. It enhances collaboration, enforces coding best practices, and ensures reproducibility in data transformations.

## Key Learnings
- **Modular SQL development**: Writing reusable, well-structured SQL models.
- **Version control and collaboration**: Leveraging Git for tracking changes.
- **Testing and documentation**: Ensuring data integrity and transparency.
- **Deployment best practices**: Managing environments and production workflows.
- **Performance optimization**: Using dbt features for scalable data transformations.
